# Music-Reconstruction-using-EEG-signals
Reconstruction of music using EEG signals. Inspired from [Brain2Image](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3123266.3127907), reconstruction will be done using generative models like variational autoencoders(VAE) and conditional generative adversarial networks(GANs). Data Collection will be done maually through [Cognitive Neuroscience Lab, BITS Goa](http://bitscogneuro.com/).  
For Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques will be used like MFDXA.
